Unit testing
Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development, focusing on testing individual units of code in isolation. 
What is unit testing?
Testing the smallest testable parts of your application (functions, classes, modules) independently.
Verifying that each unit behaves as expected, fulfilling its designed functionality.
Isolating units from external dependencies like databases or other components.

Why is it important?
Early bug detection: Catches errors in individual units before they cascade into larger issues.
Improved code quality: Encourages writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.
Enhanced confidence: Provides assurance that individual parts of your application work correctly.
Faster development cycles: Early problem identification leads to quicker fixes and better time management.



JUnit testing
JUnit is the most widely used testing framework for Java applications. JUnit is the de facto standard framework for developing unit tests in Java. It is open-source software hosted on GitHub, with an Eclipse Public License.
JUnit 5 aimed to adapt the Java 8 style of coding(lambda expressions); that’s why Java 8 is the minimum required version to create and execute tests in JUnit 5
It provides annotations to identify test methods, assert methods to perform assertions, and other features for testing Java code.


1. Annotations:

@Test

This annotation is used to identify a method as a test method.

java

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;


@Test

void myTestMethod() {
    
  // Test code goes here
}


@BeforeEach and @AfterEach

These annotations are used to specify methods that should be run before and after each test method.



import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;


@BeforeEach
void setup() {
    
  // Code to run before each test
}


@AfterEach
void tearDown() {
    
 // Code to run after each test
}


@BeforeAll and @AfterAll

These annotations are used to specify methods that should be run before and after all test methods in a test class.



import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;


@BeforeAll
static void setup() {
    
  // Code to run before all tests
}


@AfterAll
static void tearDown() {
    
  // Code to run after all tests
}


@DisplayName

This annotation is used to provide a custom display name for a test class or method.

java
Copy code
import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;


@DisplayName("My Test Class")

class MyTestClass {
 
   // Test methods go here
}


2. Assertions:

JUnit 5 provides a set of assertion methods for verifying expected results.

Common Assertions:

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;


@Test
void myTestMethod() {
    
  // Example assertions
    
  assertEquals(4, 2 + 2);
    
  assertTrue(2 > 1);
    
  assertFalse(1 > 2);
    
  assertNull(null);
    
  assertNotNull("not null");
}


Exception Assertions:

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;


@Test
void myTestMethod() {
    
  // Example exception assertions
    
  assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> {
        
   // Code that should throw an exception
        
  throw new Exception("Test Exception");
    });

}

3. Assumptions:

JUnit 5 provides Assumptions to conditionally execute tests based on certain assumptions.


import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions.*;


@Test

void myTestMethod() {
    
  assumeTrue(someCondition());
    
  // Test code that should only run if the assumption is true
}


4. Disabling Tests:

You can disable a test method or an entire test class using @Disabled annotation.


import org.junit.jupiter.api.Disabled;


@Disabled("This test is currently disabled")

@Test
void disabledTest() {
    // Test code goes here
}

Spring Web MVC testing
It helps you to write unit and integration tests for Spring MVC controllers with JUnit. It is possible to write unit or integration tests which use the Spring MVC Test framework.
Spring MVC Test framework is build on the top of the Servlet API mock objects provided by the spring-test module, it doesn’t require a servlet container.
It uses the DispatcherServlet class that provides full support for the Spring MVC runtime behavior.
The Spring MVC Test framework doesn't send real HTTP requests to the system under test. All tests are run in a mock environment provided by Spring MVC Test framework.
